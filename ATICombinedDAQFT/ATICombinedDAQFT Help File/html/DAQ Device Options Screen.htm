<H1 class="dtH1"><A NAME="DAQ Device Options Screen"></A>DAQ Device Options Screen</H1>

<P>This screen allows you to set the NI-DAQmx parameters for your DAQ hardware.</P>

<H4 class="dtH4">Device Name</H4>
<P>This is the name of the NI-DAQmx device to which the transducer is attached.  Typical NI-DAQmx names are dev1, dev2, etc.</P>

<P>You may also enter a complete NI-DAQmx multi-channel specification in this box, e.g. "dev1/ai0:5" or "dev0/ai8:9,dev1/ai4:7".  Note that the number of channels specified in this way must equal 6 (if no thermistor data is wanted) or 7 (if a thermistor is available and data should be colleccted).
</P>

<H4 class="dtH4">Sample Rate (Hz)</H4>
<P>The raw rate at which the hardware scans the transducer voltages.  <b>Please Note:</b> Divide this number by the averaging level to get the effective sample rate.</P>

<H4 class="dtH4">First Channel</H4>
<P>The lowest numbered channel on the NI-DAQmx device to which the transducer is attached.  In order for the demo to work properly, the transducer must be connected to 6 sequential channels, with gauge 0 connected to the lowest-numbered channel, gauge 1 attached to the next lowest-numbered channel, and so on.  If software temperature compensation is used, the thermistor must be on the next lowest-numbered channel after gauge 5.  The standard cable from ATI provides the correct connection.</P>
<P>This field is ignored if a NI-DAQmx multi-channel specification is entered in "Device Name"
</P>

<H4 class="dtH4">Averaging Level</H4>
<P>To reduce the noise in your data, you can enable an averaging filter by setting the averaging level to a number greater than 1.  <b>Please Note:</b> This is a "block" average, not a "sliding" average.  Therefore, divide the raw sample rate you specify on this screen by the averaging level to get the effective sample rate.</P>

<H4 class="dtH4">Connection</H4>
<P>The connection mode is the type of physical connection between the transducer and your data acquisition (DAQ) device.  You can select a differential, referenced single ended, non-referenced single ended, or pseudo-differential connection type.  All sensor systems come from ATI set up to use a differential condition, but you can modify the wiring yourself, for example, to free up channels on your DAQ device for another type of sensor to work with the F/T sensor.</P>
